# Bubble Dragons

**Bubble Dragons** is a small 2D game inspired by the classic *Bubble Bobble*, recreated in Python.  
This project is a lightweight reinterpretation featuring two playable levels, simple game mechanics, and retro-style gameplay.

The goal is to trap enemies in bubbles and eliminate them, just like in the original arcade game.  
It was developed for educational and nostalgic purposes, and serves as a base for further game development or Python game design practice.

Built using Python and Pygame.

This project also uses **g2d** and **actor.py** by *tomamic*, which are included under a free copyright license.  
These libraries helped with game graphics and actor management.
